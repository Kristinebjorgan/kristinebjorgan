# Hello, I'm Kristine Bjørgan Østby 👋

I'm a Front-End Development student, currently in Portugal and studying in my second year. I'm originally from Norway, and at age 32, I've found a true passion in coding and design.

## About Me 🌱
My journey into front-end development began just a year ago, but it has been a whirlwind of discovery and creativity. I am deeply passionate about crafting aesthetic designs that offer sublime functionality. My goal is to create digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and empowering for users.

With a professional background enriched by a degree in project management, I bring a holistic approach to the digital projects I undertake. This blend of skills enables me to construct immersive digital experiences that transcend the conventional website format.

## My Work 🚀
Two of my notable projects, the “Community Science Museum” and “Tales of Palestine,” are showcases of my dedication to merging the beautiful with the practical. Through these projects, I aim to make technology understandable, engaging and empowering.

## Interests :skateboard:
When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the skatepark. 

## Let's Connect 🤝
Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project, or if you'd like to learn more about my work. I'm always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities.

## Community Guidance 🌟
For anyone looking to get involved or needing assistance in the communities I'm part of, feel free to drop an issue or discussion in the respective repositories. I believe in fostering a welcoming and supportive environment for all contributors.
